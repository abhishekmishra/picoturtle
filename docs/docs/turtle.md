# Introduction to Turtle Graphics

Turtle Graphics is one of the simplest ways to draw vector graphics on a canvas. 
It's really simple to grasp and has very few fundamental operations. 
You (the programmer) are provided a turtle and a canvas. The turtle
holds a pen - which can write on the canvas as the turtle moves.
It is commonly used as an introduction to programming for kids because of this
simplicity. 

Inspite of being simple, turtle graphics is very powerful. An infinite variety
of 2d-graphics are possible using turtle graphics. And thus it presents a
powerful mechanism of exploring generative art. Turtle graphics is also a
unique way of exploring 2D space without the use of Cartesian geometry [[1]](#1).

## Brief History

Turtle Graphics were introduced in the 1960s as part of the LOGO programming
language. Read more at Wikipedia [[2]](#2)

## Why Learn Turtle Graphics

As mentioned in the introduction - turtle graphics is a powerful but simple
means to draw on an abstract canvas. One can explore programming, maths, and
art using the same tool. I've been exploring these fields on my own too and
therefore I felt like creating this tool. However you could have your own
valid reason you are here - which I haven't heard of before :smile:.

## What Is A Turtle?

* A _Turtle_ lives and moves in a 2-dimensional world called the _Canvas_.
* The turtle can move freely on the canvas using turn and move commands. 
* The turtle carries a _Pen_ which can draw on the canvas. While
* The turtle moves it can write on the Canvas if the pen is _down_
